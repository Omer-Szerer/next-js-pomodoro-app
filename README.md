### Small breaks, BIG impact!

Instead of wasting time doomscrolling during the short breaks, FocusFlow helps you to keep your body fit and your mind sharp by giving you the option the choose between 4 different categories with over 35 exercises!

Each time you choose either physical, meditiation, stretch, or breathing, you get a random generated exercise with an animation that shows you what to do.
